# Hosting for Flare

Free hosting is great, but isn't secure at all. Providers such as InfinityFree offer their services for free, but inject JavaScript into your site and control access. **For this reason, VANet does not officially support using or any free hosting for Flare.**

### What Does This Mean?

1. When we test Flare, we test it on our local machines. This emulates a paid hosting environment, meaning some features may break on free hosts.
2. We will not provide hosting-related support for sites using free hosts.

### What are my alternatives?

The recommended platform to host Flare is [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/). Their pricing is very reasonable and have great service. We also support other major hosting sites such as [BlueHost](https://www.bluehost.com/) and will help out where we can.

### What About Self-Hosting?

Self Hosting is where you host a site (in this case Flare) on your own server. This could be a Raspberry Pi in your house or a server in a datacenter leased by a company like [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/). These services are cheaper but more involved as you are responsible for maintaining security and installing the relevant services. As such, we assume that if you are self-hosting Flare you have advanced knowledge of the cloud and/or web development, and hence will not provide support for these. However, Flare is still tested on these platforms.
